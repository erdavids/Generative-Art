# Masonry

This project has a lot of meaning to me. It is my first project on Art Blocks and you can mint one here: https://www.artblocks.io/project/259

The code in this repo is the original mock-up code I used to validate the idea. It was developed further in P5.js for the release, but all the concepts are here. The main trick of this project was to deform both the fill and outline of each rectangle, and also to let the shapes grow outside of the "border". The result was never boring for me, and I'm incredibly happy with how it turned out.

If you want to run them yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Feel free to reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.

All of these projects are available with the intention that other people will enjoy and learn from them. 

I've included some examples from the actual code here, but there is a folder with P5.js examples as well.
